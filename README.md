# rock-paper-scissors
This is my version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors project from The Odin Project.
Practice using Flexbox, manipulating the DOM, event listeners, and CSS responsiveness for smaller windows.

Future improvements: add graphic that shows choices of both user and computer for each round, improve UI, improve score display, improve alert messaging (convert to onscreen notification [modal] rather than browser pop-up).
