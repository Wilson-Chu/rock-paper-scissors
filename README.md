# rock-paper-scissors
This is my version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors project from The Odin Project.
Practice using Flexbox, manipulating the DOM, event listeners, and CSS responsiveness for smaller windows.

For future improvement: rework UI for gameplay and restarting mechanism. Improve colours and layout of app for mobile users.
